Lip reading has been a significant need in a variety of fields today. In this application created with the words "begin", "choose", and
"connection" from the Miracl-VC1 dataset. CNN, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were used. Random Forest,
with 91.7 percent accuracy, and CNN, with 88.8 percent accuracy, are the highest. In the next step was created a gui to validate the
CNN model with data that is independent of the speaker.
